# EasyCQRS

### Easy CQRS with ASP.NET Core and MediatR

Are your controller actions gigantic? Is your service layer bloated? Are testing and maintenance a nightmare?  Need a scalable solution?

The CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) development pattern can help address these issues. But implementing a distributed CQRS architecture can be intimidating. If not well designed, it can make your application exponentially more complex and difficult to maintain.  

So why not start simple?

Using the popular .NET library, MediatR, it’s super easy to write simple, testable, scalable CQRS applications. In this session, we will explore CQRS and its core concepts while building a mind-blowingly simple ASP.NET Core application with MediatR. We will emphasize separation of concerns, dependency injection, code reuse, thin controllers, and unit testability.  You will leave with knowledge and confidence to start using MediatR in your own projects.
